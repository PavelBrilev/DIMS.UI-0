### There are three roles in the application:

- Admin (Has access rights to everything except students' subtasks and etc for other roles)
- Menthor (Has access rights to add and delete tasks; accepts/does'n accept tasks)
- Student (Has access rights to add and delete subtasks; marks as completed tasks)

## Issue

The application allows you to register new students, delete and change their data. There is
the ability to create new tasks, indicating students who need to complete them in
set time. When completing a task, the student can mark the task as completed,
the mentor can accept the implementation, or send for revision. The student
can split tasks into smaller subtasks. Access to functionality
the application depends on the role of the user (admin, mentor or student).
